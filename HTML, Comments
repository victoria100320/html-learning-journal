    <!--Exercise 1: Insert a Valid Comment
      Inside the <body> element of your HTML page, add a comment.
      The comment should say exactly:
      This paragraph explains the author's bio
      Do not place any HTML elements inside the comment.
    -->

      <!--This paragraph explains the author's bio-->
      
    <!--Exercise 2: Use a Comment to Explain Structure
        Above a paragraph containing this text:
        John is a front-end developer with a passion for accessible design.

        Insert a comment that says:
        Section: Author Information

        Make sure the comment is on its own line and not inside the paragraph.
    -->
    <!--Author Information-->
      <p>
        John is a front-end developer with a passion for accessible design
      </p>
      
      
    <!--Exercise 3: Hide a Paragraph with a Comment
          Write a paragraph with the following text:
          This content is under review and should not appear on the page.
  
          Do not delete the paragraph. Instead, surround it with a valid HTML comment so it is completely ignored by the browser.
  
          Confirm it does not appear when the page is rendered
    -->
      <!--
        <p>This content is under review and should not appear on the page.</p>
      -->
      
      
    <!--Exercise 4: Add a TODO Comment for a Future Feature
      At the very bottom of the <body> section, add a comment.

      The comment should say:
      TODO: Add team member bios below this line

      Ensure the comment is placed on a new line with no HTML below it.
    -->
    
    
    <!--Exercise 5: Add an Invalid Comment â€” Then Fix It
        Create a comment that incorrectly contains double hyphens, like this (but without using this exact format):
        Include two hyphens together inside your comment text.

        Observe what happens in the browser or DevTools (there may be a parsing error or unexpected behavior).

        Fix the comment so it no longer contains -- anywhere between the comment tags.
    -->
    <!--Include -- two hyphens together inside your comment text.-->
    <!--Include two hyphens together inside your comment text.-->
